- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Sass
- [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Boostrap

### What I learned

I definitely struggled the most with fixing the images for both mobile and desktop. In the end, I just decided to "display:none" and "display:block" using media queries.

### Useful resources

- [Display:none vs. Visibility:hidden (in spanish)](https://cybmeta.com/display-none-vs-visibility-hidden-y-tu-como-escondes-las-cosas) - This helped me with the images for mobile/desktop.
